I'm a 3rd year PhD student in the University of Pennsylvania advised by
[Sebastian Angel](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sga001/). I am broadly interested
in adapting traditional security frameworks to be more privacy preserving using
techniques such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs. I'm always open to collaboration or disucssions about privacy and security! Feel free to reach out!
bio: >
Before starting my PhD I worked for 3 years in industry as a Security Engineer
at Meta. During my Master's at Duke University I was fortunate to work
with [Ashwin Machanavajjhala](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ashwin/) and [Charles Becker](https://sites.duke.edu/charlesbecker/). I completed my Bachelor's at
Stanford. I'm originally from New Orleans and spend most of my free time rowing with
[Vesper Boat Club](https://vesperboatclub.org/).
