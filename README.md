About me
==========

I'm a 3rd year PhD student in the University of Pennsylvania advised by
[Sebastian Angel](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sga001/). I am broadly interested in adapting traditional security frameworks to be more privacy preserving using techniques such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
Before starting my PhD I worked for 3 years in industry as a Security Engineer
at Meta.

During my Master's at Duke University I was fortunate to work
with [Ashwin Machanavajjhala](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ashwin/) and [Charles Becker](https://sites.duke.edu/charlesbecker/). I completed my Bachelor's at
Stanford. 

I'm originally from New Orleans and spend most of my free time rowing.
